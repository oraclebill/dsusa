Feature: add cabinet info 
	
	As a customer
	I need to be able to specify my cabinet selection and options
	So that the designers understand the constraints of the design
	  and I can indicate things that are not easy to indicate legibly
	  in the floorplan drawing
	
	Scenario: add cabinet info 
		Given I am on the order details page 
		When I say 'hip' 
		Then you say 'hop'
