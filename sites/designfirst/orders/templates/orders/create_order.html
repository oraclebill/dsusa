		<h2>Creating a design request</h2>
		<p>To order a design you must create a design request. A design request must contain all of the information 
			our designers will need to create your 20/20 Design. The most important piece of information 
			we need is your floorplan sketch. 
		</p>
		<p>There are a couple of ways you can send us your floorplan sketch -
			<ul>
				<li>Scan and upload
					<p>If you have access to a scanner this is the best option. We accept most common image formats, 
					including GIF, JPG, PNG and PDF. Files must be smaller than 2 megabytes, however - this should
					not be a problem if you set your scanner to scan as a black and white image, at less than 150 dpi (dots per inch)
					75 dpi usually works fine.</p>
					<p>Once you've uploaded your file we will show it to you so you can verify it's readable. If you need to make changes and  upload again, 
					press 'No' when asked if you accept this image, and you can try again, or perform this step later.</p>
					</li>
				<li>Fax using our coded fax cover sheet
					<p>Design Service USA has automated fax servers that process documents sent to us. 
					If you fax us your floorplan using a coversheet coded with your new request id, we will
					automatically associate your faxed diagram with your order. This process usually only takes minutes
					so if you fax it now before starting the design request wizard, your diagram will attached to while
					you enter data and you can review it online before submitting your order.
					</p>
					<p><a href="{# % url fax_cover order % #}">Click here to download a fax cover sheet for this order here.</a></p>
					<p>In some cases we can't automatically identify your document due to errors introduced by the faxing process.
					If your fax is not attached to your order when you complete the wizard, you should 
					<a href="{# % url fax_cover order % #}">download a new cover sheet</a>
					and resend the fax. If this fails, <a href="{# % url contact_support account order % #}">contact support</a>
					and we can manually attach your fax to your order.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p> 
		<p>
			If you have your floorplan sketch please take the time to fax that to us now.
		   	In order to ensure timely processing make sure you use the 
			{# <a href="{% url fax_cover order %}">special fax cover sheet</a>. #}
			
			This cover sheet has all of your account and order information plus barcodes that
			we use to automatically attach your diagram to your order.
		</p>
		<p>
		 	Your fax order submission number is - {{ account.fax_submission_number }}.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once your sketch is received and you complete the web form your order can be submitted.
