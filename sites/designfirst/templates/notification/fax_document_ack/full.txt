DSUSA's automated fax document processing system
uses barcode recognition to correlate the documents we
receive with customer orders and accounts. By using the
special coded fax cover sheet that we generate for you
when you create or submit your order, our system can
quickly and reliably attach your diagrams and other
documents to your design order.

Re-using old cover sheets or sending
documents without the proper cover sheet can introduce
errors and/or delays in processing, so please review
the summary above carefully and contact support if
there are any issues or discrepancies.

Thanks for using Design Service USA!
